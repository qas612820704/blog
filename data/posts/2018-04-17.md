Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
```

**Note:**

- Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
- The divisor will never be 0.
- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: $[-2^{31}, 2^{31 -1}]$. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns $2^{31} - 1$ when the division result overflows.
